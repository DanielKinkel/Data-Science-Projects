This project was intended to give an overview of the methodology of Extreme Gradient Boosting which is a machine learning algorithm that has gained significant popularity due to its remarkable results in multiple machine learning challenges.

Since the methodology was new to me as well, I developed a better understanding of the functionality as well as some the reasons that make this algorithm so effective. 
I have also gained experience in applying the algorithm and training its various hyperparameters via multiple grid searches.
