This project resolves around text mining and sentiment analysis.
The sentiment of ad hoc announcements was measured using a dictionary-based approach and its effect on the daily return was estimated using regression analysis.

Working on this project, I have learned a lot about necessary preprocessing steps in text mining like removing unnecessary spaces and punctuation in the text, harmonizing, stemming and removing stop words. Further I have learned that the results strongly depend on the decision which dictionary to use.
It also was a good experience to see what kind of value can be derived from unstructured data, which represents the vast majority of data that is available.
