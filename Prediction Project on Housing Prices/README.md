This project was a learning experience in predicting housing prices. 
The intention was to get more familiar with the prediction of numeric outcomes aka regression problems.

The analysis starts with a thorough regression analysis including multiple residual checks and comparing the results to typical ensemble methods.
Besides fulfilling the initially proposed intention, this project also was a good exercise in writing code in a shorter amount of time without 
compromising on the level of detail.
