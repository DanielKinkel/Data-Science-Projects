This project represents my first experience with machine learning and programming in R.
The challenge was to compare multiple models to predict the daily cash flows for a given dataset.

During this project I have learned a lot about the fundamentals of data science and modelling. I have learned about data splitting and validation approaches.
I had a first experience with applying a machine learning algorithm like random forests and hyperparameter tuning. It also was a great learning experience of
how to work on something I had no prior knowledge about and make use of open-access learning material or community-driven coding websites like stackoverflow.
