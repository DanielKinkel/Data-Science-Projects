This project was my first one in python.
The idea was to develop multiple models to predict which employees would decide to leave a given company and compare the accuracies. 

This project has helped to familiarize myself with typical python libraries like NumPy, panda, scikit-learn and the general use of python as a language.
It also was experience in using multiple validation approaches for binary predictions like ROC curves and F1 scores, which were important since the 
classes in the data set were imbalanced.
